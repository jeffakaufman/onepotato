      <p><h3>Ingredients Handling Guide<br />
</h3>One Potato works with farmers, ranchers and fisheries to send you the freshest sustainable organic ingredients to prepare delicious meals every day. With a little TLC, your produce, meats, fish and dry goods will remain fresh and vibrant until you’re ready to cook and enjoy. Please follow these simple tips for best results.</p>
<p><h3>General Guidelines<br />
</h3>Unpack your ingredients as soon as possible: Store fish, meat and eggs in the coolest part of your refrigerator, and below prepared or ready to eat foods.</p>
<p>Vegetables and greens are best refrigerated in your vegetable drawer or on a lower middle shelf. Our delicious sauces and marinades have a long refrigerated life, but should be frozen if you plan to use them more than ten days after receiving.</p>
<p>Fresh herbs can be stored as received; however, wrapping them in damp paper towels will ensure their longevity throughout the week.</p>
<p>One Potato fish and shellfish will keep well for up to seven days refrigerated in their sealed bags. If you plan to use these ingredients more than seven days after receiving them, we suggest placing them in the freezer as soon as they are received. Plan your meals in order to use fish and shellfish early in the week for pristine freshness.</p>
<p>Meat and Poultry will keep well for up to seven days in their sealed bags. If you plan on preparing these ingredients more than seven days after receiving, we suggest placing the sealed bags directly in the freezer upon receiving them.<br />
Once freezing your meat, poultry or fish products: Remove from the freezer and thaw in the refrigerator overnight. If you wish to thaw frozen ingredients more quickly, place the frozen sealed bags in a container and thaw under cold running water [please consider water is one of our valuable, ever scarcer resources, kindly use with prudence].</p>
<p><h3>Handling of Raw Meat, Fish and Poultry</h3><br />
One Potato works with farmers and ranchers who treat their animals humanely and pay great attention to their animal’s health and well being. Still, bacteria and pathogens that can cause food borne illness are always a risk. To protect your family, One Potato recommends the following best practices in food safety during meal preparation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always begin with a clean and sanitized work area, cutting board, bowls, knives and utensils.</li>
<li>Clean and sanitize cutting boards after the preparation of any one ingredient before preparing the next ingredients.</li>
<li>Prepare meats fish and poultry after all other ingredients have been prepared, and ensure cleaning and sanitizing knives, cutting boards and work areas after their preparations. Thoroughly was hands with soap and warm water after touching raw ingredients, and sanitize faucet handles as an extra precaution against cross contamination.</li>
<li>The USDA lists the following recommendations for handling raw ingredients:<br />
a) Clean &#8211; Wash hands and surfaces often.<br />
b) Separate &#8211; Separate raw meat from other foods.<br />
c) Cook &#8211; Cook to the right temperature.<br />
d) Chill &#8211; Refrigerate prepped food promptly if using later in the day<br />
e) Chill &#8211; Refrigerate leftover foods as soon as your meals are finished.</li>
</ol>
<p><h3>Cooking Raw Meat, Fish and Poultry<br />
</h3>Beef, Lamb and Pork should be cooked until an internal temperature of 145°F. is reached, and then left to rest for five minutes before serving.</p>
<p>Poultry and All Ground, Chopped or Minced Meats should cooked until an internal temperature of 165°F is reached and then left to rest for five minutes prior to serving.</p>
<p>Fish and Shellfish is safest when cooked to an internal temperature of 145°F.</p>
<p>Eggs are considered safest to consume after cooking to an internal temperature of 160°F.<br />
One Potato delivers only USDA Grade A Organic Pasteurized eggs. Products which contain raw egg, such as our cookie doughs and mayonnaise based sauces, are prepared using the same eggs. If your children yearn for raw cookie dough, feel safe indulging them.</p>
<p><h3>Aromatics, Tomatoes and Potatoes</h3><br />
One Potato will occasionally ship whole tomatoes, onions, potatoes, autumn squashes, shallots and ginger. Such staple items generally keep well for up to a week in a cool dry place, such as an airy cupboard or shaded countertop area. If holding the ingredients longer than a week, we recommend storing them in the refrigerator and removing when ready to use. Fresh whole tomatoes are at their best when at room temperature. We strongly urge that these remain out until ready to use, or removing them from the refrigerator several hours prior to preparation.</p>
<p><h3>Breads</h3><br />
At One Potato we are huge fans of the old fashioned bread drawer, a cool dry place to keep your fresh breads for several days. Tortillas, French Baguettes and Rolls will stay fresh for up to four days under these conditions. If you are planning to use these ingredients later on, please wrap tightly in plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for up to ten days. For longer storage, wrap in two layers of plastic and place in the freezer until ready to use.</p>
<p><h3>CHEESES</h3><br />
Store sliced, shredded and grated cheese in the refrigerator until ready to use. If you wish to store your cheeses for longer than ten days, we recommend wrapping them in several layers of plastic wrap and freezing until ready to use.</p>
<p><h3>Organic Grains and Pasta</h3><br />
Rice and grains are best kept refrigerated in their sealed bags. If desired to store in the pantry, remove the grains from the sealed packaging and place in a glass, ceramic or terracotta jar, covered.</p>
<p>Dried pastas are best kept in the pantry until ready to use.</p>
<p><h3>One Potato Cookie Doughs</h3><br />
One Potatoes Organic cookie doughs keep well stored in the refrigerator for up to ten days. Remove the dough several minutes before using. If there is leftover cookie dough, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and return to the refrigerator as soon as possible.<br />
Our cookie dough also freezes extremely well, and will keep frozen for up to two months. When ready to bake cookies: remove the dough from the freezer and cut into thin discs. Remove the wrapper after cutting, bake and enjoy!</p>
