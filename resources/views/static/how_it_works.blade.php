      <p>First, tell us the size of your family and your meal preferences.</p>
      <p>We send you an email with pictures and recipes of the incredibly delicious dinners you’ll be having the following week.</p>
      <p>Going out of town? Just click and tell us you don’t need the help.</p>
      <p>This is the fun part. Every One Potato day, a box of incredibly fresh, organic food arrives at your home, packed in a recyclable, insulated box. What’s more, it’s measured and chopped, ready to prepare. If a chili recipe calls for a teaspoon of cumin, there it is, neatly labeled, in its own little cup. Two tablespoons of olive oil are in a tiny screw-top jar. Six sprigs of fresh cilantro are ready to garnish the bowl.</p>
      <p>Your kids will say, “Mmm, what’s that?” They may even set the table to get the dinner party started.</p>
