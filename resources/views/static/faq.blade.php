      <h1>How does One Potato work?</h1>
      <img class="alignright" src="/img/faq.jpg" alt="faq" width="50%" />
      <p>One Potato delivers all the fresh, organic ingredients you need to make delicious meals in exactly the right proportions.</p>
      <p>First, tell us the size of your family and your meal preferences. We send you an email with pictures and recipes of the incredibly delicious dinners you’ll be having the following week. Going out of town? Just click and tell us you don’t need the help. We have no membership fee, and no minimum commitment. You can skip any week’s delivery in advance or cancel at any time.</p>
      <p>This is the fun part. Every One Potato day, a box of incredibly fresh, organic food arrives at your home, packed in a cooled, insulated box. What’s more, it’s measured and chopped, ready to prepare. If a chili recipe calls for a teaspoon of cumin, there it is, neatly labeled, in its own little cup. Two tablespoons of olive oil are in a tiny screw-top jar. Six sprigs of fresh cilantro are ready to garnish the bowl. Your kids will say, “Mmm, what’s that?” They may even set the table to get the dinner party started.</p>
      <h2>How do I recycle my One Potato box?</h2>
      <p>We’ve worked closely with our suppliers to create packaging that is all recyclable or made of biodegradable materials.</p>
      <p>Here’s how to dispose of your One Potato packaging in the most environmentally friendly way:</p>
      <p><h3>The box:</h3></p>
      <p>Your box should be flattened, then recycled with standard cardboard/paper recycling. The cardboard inserts and paper liners can be recycled with the box as well.</p>
      <p><h3>Bags and bottles:</h3></p>
      <p>All small plastic bags and bottles can be recycled with plastic recyclables.</p>
      <p>These are #4 and #2 recyclables respectively.</p>
      <p><h3>Liner:</h3></p>
      <p>The the outside is recyclable with your plastics, and the inside is made of biodegradable materials. Please remove the outside layer and recycle, and dispose of the inside in your regular garbage.</p>
      <p><h3>Ice packs:</h3></p>
      <p>Our ice packs are filled with a non-toxic gel. To recycle them completely, cut them open and dispose of the gel, then recycle the exterior packaging with your plastics.</p>
      <p>Note: Please always check with your local municipality as recycling capabilities can vary.</p>

      <h2>Why is the family meal important?</h2>
      <p>Studies have shown that eating dinner together as a family has a positive impact on children’s behavior and eating habits, but preparing a meal that every member of the family will enjoy is often difficult. One Potato believes that it’s possible to prepare one meal to satisfy everyone at the dinner table. By offering recipes that appeal to both kids and adults alike, One Potato saves the family chef from feeling like an unappreciated short order cook. Reap the rewards of easy, tasty recipes, prepared in 30 minutes or less, and begin to enjoy dinner time again.</p>
