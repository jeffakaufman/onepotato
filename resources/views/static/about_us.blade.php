      <p>The idea for One Potato was cooked up in our home kitchens. As busy parents, we shared similar frustrations about feeding our children fresh, healthy meals that were easy to prepare and appealed to everyone. We’ve always enjoyed cooking, but found that preparing complicated, gourmet dishes just didn’t work with the reality of life as a parent. The options available – takeout, frozen dinners, and dining out – were either prohibitively expensive or didn’t seem healthy (or both). Other meal kit delivery services, while convenient, didn’t offer recipes that appealed to our kids. We created One Potato to feed our families and yours; and to ensure that parents around the country no longer dread the question, "what’s for dinner?"</p>
