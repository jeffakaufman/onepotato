      <h2>Recipes the Whole Family will Enjoy.</h2>
      <p>Hundreds of tasty and healthy recipes that satisfy fussy eaters while at the same time bringing new flavors to your table.</p>
      <h2>Organic Proteins and Produce</h2>
      <p>Like all moms and dads, we want to make sure our kids eat as healthy as possible. At One Potato, all produce and proteins are certified organic. We partner with local farms and vendors to ensure every One Potato box is full of the freshest, healthiest ingredients available.</p>
      <h2>Partially Prepped Ingredients for Quick &amp; Easy Meals</h2>
      <p>With pre-cut and measured fresh ingredients, preparing a meal can be easy and fun, and something all children can help with. From stove to plate in under 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>In addition to engaging your kids in meaningful “tasks,” cooking puts into action so much of what they learn at school – reading, math and world cultures. So tell them to put down the homework and pick up a spoon.</p>
      <h2>One Family. One Meal.</h2>
      <p>Studies have shown that eating dinner together as a family has a positive impact on children’s behavior and eating habits, but preparing a meal that every member of the family will enjoy is often difficult. One Potato believes that it’s possible to prepare one meal to satisfy everyone at the dinner table. By offering recipes that appeal to both kids and adults alike, One Potato saves the family chef from feeling like an unappreciated short order cook. Reap the rewards of easy, tasty recipes, prepared in 30 minutes or less, and begin to enjoy dinner time again.</p>
      <h2>Giving Back</h2>
      <p>One Potato partners with L.A. Kitchen, a local non-profit providing food-related jobs and resources to empower, nourish, and engage the community. Preparing One Potato meals gives L.A. Kitchen employees new career skills.</p>
      <p>One Potato is committed to helping families who lack the resources to access to fresh, organic foods. For every box ordered from our service, we will donate a meal to a family in need.</p>
